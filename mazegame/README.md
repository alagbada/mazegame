### sprites used
Could not find the sprites used in the video, but a close substitute was used.

### Technology used
React is used in developing the game, the state is managed with Redux.

### how the game is played
The game is initiated by entering the number of rows and columns when you are prompted to enter values while the game is loaded.

The player is moved around the maze by using the direction keys on the keyboard.

The number of enemies in the game is the square root of the product of both the number of rows and columns.
For Example, if the game is prompted with 10*10, the number of enemies will be approximately 10.

At the end of the game, the distance covered by the player to clear the enemy is displayed in the alert.
